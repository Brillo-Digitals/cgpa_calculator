🎓 CGPA Calculator

A simple and efficient CGPA Calculator built to help students compute their GPA and cumulative CGPA accurately and effortlessly. This app eliminates manual calculations and reduces errors by automating grade-point computation based on credit units.

📌 Overview

Calculating GPA manually can be stressful and error-prone, especially when handling multiple courses and semesters. CGPA Calculator provides a clean and user-friendly interface where students can input course details and instantly get accurate results.

This project focuses on practical academic problem-solving while demonstrating structured logic implementation and clean UI design.

✨ Features
